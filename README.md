## Technologies We Use

**Sucodev** uses a range of advanced and powerful technologies to deliver optimal software solutions. Below is a detailed description of the
technologies that we apply in our projects:

### üåê Frontend Development

-   **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript**: This is the basic foundation for developing web interfaces. HTML provides the structure for the web page,
    CSS for styling, and JavaScript/TypeScript for dynamic interactions. TypeScript helps improve the quality of source code with static data type
    checking.
-   **Vue.js 2 & 3**:Vue.js is a powerful and flexible JavaScript framework that helps develop dynamic web applications with ease of use and optimized
    performance.
-   **Nuxt.js**: L√† m·ªôt framework d·ª±a tr√™n Vue.js, Nuxt.js gi√∫p x√¢y d·ª±ng c√°c ·ª©ng d·ª•ng SSR (Server-Side Rendering) m·ªôt c√°ch d·ªÖ d√†ng v√† t·ªëi ∆∞u h√≥a hi·ªáu
    su·∫•t t·∫£i trang.
-   **React.js**: React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces, making web applications fast and easy to
    maintain.
-   **Shopify, WordPress**:These platforms make it easy and efficient to build online stores (Shopify) and content management websites (WordPress).
-   **Tailwind CSS**:This is a handy CSS framework that helps develop fast and flexible user interfaces using utility classes.

### üì± Mobile Development

-   **React Native**: Based on React, React Native allows developing mobile applications for both iOS and Android from a common source code base. This

    helps save time and development costs.

-   **Flutter**: Flutter is a framework by Google that helps develop mobile applications with high performance and smooth interfaces on both Android
    and iOS.

-   **Swift (iOS)**: Swift is Apple's official development language for mobile applications on the iOS operating system, helping to build efficient
    and powerful applications.

-   **Kotlin (Android)**: Kotlin is an official language of Android, designed to replace Java, helping to speed up development and reduce errors

    in Android applications.

### üíª Backend Development

-   **Java**: Java is a popular programming language for developing large-scale enterprise applications and powerful backend systems. With its
    cross-platform compatibility, Java is the top choice for distributed systems.

-   **Node.js**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that helps build backend applications quickly and efficiently, especially APIs and
    large-scale network systems.

-   **Go**: Go (Golang) is a programming language developed by Google, which is very suitable for building high-performance, scalable, and concurrent
    backend systems.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud & Infrastructure

-   **Server, VPS**: Solutions like server and VPS (Virtual Private Server) help host your applications on independent servers, providing greater
    flexibility and control than traditional hosting.

    -   **Google Cloud, AWS**: Popular cloud platforms like Google Cloud and AWS (Amazon Web Services) provide cloud computing services that make it
        easy to deploy, scale, and manage applications. Companies can leverage services like storage, database, compute, and networking to increase
        scalability and security.

### üöÄ DevOps

-   **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**: CI/CD is a methodology that automates the process of testing, integrating, and deploying
    software. This ensures that software is tested and deployed quickly, minimizing errors and waiting times. With CI/CD, we can automate development
    tasks, from building source code to deploying to production.

### ü§ñ AI & Machine Learning

-   **AI image processing**: We use artificial intelligence (AI) to process and analyze images, helping applications recognize and classify objects in
    images or videos. These applications can be used in areas such as healthcare, facial recognition, and smart transportation.
